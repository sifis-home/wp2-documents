# Infrastracture Assessment

@lucaardito could you please explain what should be added in this section? Is it something related to Polito or CNR? How could an infrastructure be evaluated? 

@Luni-4 the idea was to combine the labels of all the components inside the infrastructure. Let's call it `meta-evaluation`

@lucaardito So what's the assessment here? What do you mean with the term `components`? Please provide a better description on what this section should contain, some example, a use-case, something like that, thanks!
