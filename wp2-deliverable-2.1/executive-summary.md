# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

This document reports the theoretical and practical aspects of measuring the quality and security of source code produced in the SIFIS-Home project or by third-party developers developing apps expected to run on the SIFIS-Home framework. 

The document is intended to provide a baseline for the definition of secure coding guidelines, which will be reported in D2.2 and D2.4. We will review here the main techniques and formalisms to evaluate the quality and reliability for general software, discussing how these measures are relevant for applications developed for the SIFIS-Home framework, presenting at first general quality metrics and then focusing on security and privacy-related indexes, as they are defined in the literature.

A subset of these metrics will also be used by the mechanisms to evaluate the quality and security of SIFIS-Home applications provided by third-party developers through the tools for evaluating the software defined in D2.3 and D2.5.
