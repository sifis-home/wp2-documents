# Security and Privacy Metrics

What should we write here?

- Measures reporting code mistakes that might imply vulnerabilities (e.g. Stall Ratio, Critical Element Ratio...)
- Usage of code blocks that expose the program to memory-based security attacks (e.g. buffer overflow).
- Measures about data traceability, including approaches based on data tainting.
- Usage of API and libraries known to be deprecated due to or implying security vulnerabilities.
- Usage of security protocols in network-based applications.   

# Privacy and Security Assessment Techniques

*We need to validate the procedures used to create the privacy and security fields of our own label?*

Below some links about a possible validation process and its explanation

For each one of the arguments, Privacy, Security, Ownership and Governance), various criteria have been identified. Then, at each criteria is associated an indicator and the corresponding procedure to evaluate it through data/links/automatic tests and so on.
