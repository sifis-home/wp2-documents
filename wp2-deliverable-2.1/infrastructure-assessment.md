# Infrastracture Assessment

The label associated to an app that controls an *IoT* device within a house is analyzed (we need to define how, but first we need to create a label!!!). Then the average among the labels needs to be computed in some way such that the entire infrastructure can be assessed.

Some questions: 

* Where should the tool that assess the infrastructure run? I presume on the gateway because we are following up the WebThing approach. So the average among the labels occurs there. 
* Since we are not interested in device labels, how can we get the labels associated to each app in order to compute the average? Whenever a request is sent to a gateway by an app?

Need to know how the infrastructure is structured first.
