# Conclusion

In this document we have treated the theoretical and practical aspects of measuring the quality and security of source codes produced in the SIFIS-Home project.

In chapter 2, we have described the techniques to assess the quality of a software through the use of static and dynamic methods. To do so, we have presented and listed the most common metrics present in literature.
In this chapter, we have also introduced a set of modern and most used tools, both closed and open source, which perform this kind of analysis.
