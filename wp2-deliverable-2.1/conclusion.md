# Conclusion

This document has treated the theoretical and practical aspects of measuring the quality and security of source codes produced in the SIFIS-Home project.

In Section 2, we have described the techniques to assess software quality through the use of static and dynamic methods. To do so, we have presented and listed the most common metrics present in the literature.
This section has also introduced a set of modern and most used tools, both closed and open-source, which perform this kind of analysis. Section 3 reports a high-level overview of methodologies to evaluate security aspects in source code to identify code blocks that might pose exploitable vulnerabilities.
